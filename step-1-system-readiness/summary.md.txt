# Step 1 – System Readiness and Startup Impact Validation

## Objective
To verify that the system is stable and ready for troubleshooting activities, and to validate how startup applications affect system performance after boot.

## Actions Performed
- Verified system configuration and hardware details using `msinfo32`
- Checked available disk space to ensure sufficient capacity for stable operation
- Confirmed system protection was enabled to allow safe rollback during troubleshooting
- Enabled additional non-critical startup applications to observe performance behavior

## Observation
After enabling extra startup applications and rebooting the system, CPU utilization showed temporary spikes during login. This confirmed that startup load can directly impact boot-time system performance.

## Conclusion
The system was verified to be healthy and prepared for troubleshooting tasks. Startup configuration was identified as a potential factor affecting performance, establishing a reliable baseline for subsequent troubleshooting steps.
