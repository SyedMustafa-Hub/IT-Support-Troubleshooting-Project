# Step 2 – Performance Troubleshooting (Slow System)

## Issue
User reported that the system was slow after startup.

## Diagnosis
Initial analysis using Task Manager showed high memory utilization and multiple non-essential applications running automatically after login. This indicated excessive startup load as the primary cause of the performance issue.

## Root Cause
Non-essential startup applications were consuming system memory and resources during boot, leading to delayed responsiveness.

## Resolution
Identified and disabled non-essential startup applications using Task Manager while keeping critical security and system services enabled.

## Verification
After rebooting the system, CPU usage stabilized faster and overall system responsiveness improved, confirming that startup optimization resolved the issue.

## Status
Resolved
