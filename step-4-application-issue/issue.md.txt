# Step 4 – Application Installation Issue (Permission / UAC)

## Issue
User reported being unable to install an application on the system.

## Diagnosis
The installer required administrative privileges to make system-level changes. When run normally under a standard user context, installation could not proceed due to User Account Control (UAC) restrictions.

## Root Cause
Standard user permissions prevented the application from installing system-wide software without administrator approval.

## Resolution
The installer was executed using **Run as administrator**, and the UAC prompt was approved to grant the required privileges.

## Verification
The application installed successfully and launched without errors after installation.

## Status
Resolved
